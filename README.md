# Diabetes-Prediction
A classification problem built for detection of Diabetes using variety of other parameters.    
The dataset used are courtesy of Dr John Schorling, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine

Description regarding the dataset:  
The data consist of 19 variables on 403 subjects from 1046 subjects who were interviewed in a study to
understand the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia
for African Americans. According to Dr John Hong, Diabetes Mellitus Type II (adult onset diabetes) is
associated most strongly with obesity. The waist/hip ratio may be a predictor in diabetes and heart
disease. DM II is also agssociated with hypertension - they may both be part of "Syndrome X". The 403
subjects were the ones who were actually screened for diabetes. Glycosolated hemoglobin > 7.0 is
usually taken as a positive diagnosis of diabetes.
